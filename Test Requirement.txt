🧪 AI Developer Test – Based on the Existing E-commerce Project


Test Project: https://bitbucket.org/dredsoft-labs/ecommerce/src/main/


Objective:
Run the test project and test the candidate's ability to enhance a basic e-commerce experience with AI functionality, such as product recommendations, smart search, or dynamic pricing.
Test Brief:
Build a small e-commerce product catalog app and integrate one AI feature that enhances user interaction or decision-making.
Requirements:
1. Product Catalog Viewer (Basic UI)
* Display a static list of 8–12 sample products (JSON is fine).

   * Fields: product name, price, category, description, rating

      * Include a basic filter or search bar (by category or price)

2. AI Feature (choose one)
Choose one of the following AI features to implement:
________________


🧠 Option A – Smart Product Search (NLP)
 Use a basic NLP model or the OpenAI API to allow natural language search across the catalog.
Example input: "Show me running shoes under $100 with good reviews"
________________


🧠 Option B – Dynamic Pricing Engine
 Use a simple ML model (or rule-based logic) to recommend or display adjusted product prices based on:
         * Demand, ratings, category, or time (can be mocked)
________________


🧠 Option C – Recommendation System
 Based on user selections or profile (e.g., preferred categories, budget), suggest 3–5 relevant products.
         * Rule-based or basic ML is fine
________________


Bonus (Optional)
Write 2–3 sentences describing how this AI could be integrated with blockchain features (e.g., token-gated pricing, on-chain user preferences, loyalty smart contracts).
________________


Deliverables:
Please submit:
         * A short video walkthrough (2–3 minutes)

         * Source code (via GitHub link or zip)

         * A README.md with:

            * How to run the app

            * Which AI feature you choose

            * Tools/libraries used

            * Any notable assumptions
Time Limit:
Try to complete the test within 1 hour.. We're looking for thoughtful implementation, not production polish.
